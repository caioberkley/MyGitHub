# MyGitHub
 Github Public API Swift Project

App made for a challenge requested by a private company, in order to query GitHub's Public API and access user data: 

- MVVM
- ViewCode
- SPM (KingFisher)

To use it, just run the app on the simulator or compatible iOS device (iOS 15 or higher) perform a search by typing in the search box, to clear the search just swipe down (probably will change in the future) 

Project not fully finalized, this first version I consider only as an MVP for evaluation, with base functionalities made in the available delivery time.
